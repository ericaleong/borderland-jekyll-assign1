        <h2>Collagen - It's Nature's Botox!</h2>

    <p>Let’s be real. We all wish we could slow the hands of time. For some of us, this is especially true when it comes to the appearance of our skin! One of the ways that we’re improving our skin naturally is through the use of collagen. The anti-aging effects of collagen is one of the major benefits of bone broth. You may have heard that collagen is good for your hair skin and nails, but how exactly does it help? And does the science support it? In this blog post, we answer both of these questions and show you why collagen is basically nature’s botox.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-collagen">What is collagen?</h2>

<p>Simply put, collagen is a protein! It’s the most abundant protein in our bodies and it’s responsible for holding our connective tissues together, including our skin! Collagen is the protein that gives our skin elasticity, and is also a major player in our  hair and nail health as well! Collagen is made up of two amino acids- glycine and proline.</p>

<p>As we get older, the amount of collagen that our bodies produce slows down, which is why we start to see fine lines, less elasticity and an overall less “plump” appearance to our skin. This slow down in collagen production varies between individuals but can start as early as our late 20’s! There are many factors that determine the age at which the collagen production slows down, among which are genetic factors, alcohol intake, sun exposure, and diet!</p>

<p>Given this information, it’s no surprise that collagen is the top priority for many when it comes to battling the aging process!</p>

<h2 id="what-does-science-say">What does science say?</h2>

<p>Lucky for us, there have been multiple studies which examine the efficacy of oral collagen supplementation on our skin! Science tells us that increasing collagen intake can improve the appearance of our skin by decreasing fine lines, improving elasticity, and improving hydration. There has even been a systematic review examining collagen’s impact on our skin! (A systematic review is a thorough examination of a whole bunch of research, and is pretty much the pinnacle of research!)</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, scientific research has shown collagen to be very helpful when it comes to slowing down and even reversing the ageing process!</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-get-these-incredible-health-and-skin-benefits">How do I get these incredible health and skin benefits?</h2>

<p>Collagen is only found in animal proteins, and the simplest way of dramatically increasing your collagen intake is to incorporate bone broth into your diet! When animal bones are boiled over a long period time, as they are when making bone broth, the collagen that’s hiding in the cartilage is extracted! This leaves us with a nutrient rich broth, full of collagen- it’s basically youth in a bottle!</p>
