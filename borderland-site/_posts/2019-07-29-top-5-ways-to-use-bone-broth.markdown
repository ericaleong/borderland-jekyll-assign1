Ok. I'm going to open by saying that if you have only been sipping bone broth straight up or using it in the conventional ways (soups, stews and chilli), then you have been mega big time missing out and you're about to thank me!
Listen up. Bone broth is amazing. But, who the heck wants to sip hot bone broth or make a winter comfort food in the middle of the gaddang summer?! NO ONE DOES. But we still want the amazing health benefits of the delicious superfood. What to do.

This age old conundrum is why we've created Canada's only tasteless bone broth! We call it a Smoothie Booster, but it can be used for so much more than smoothies! Ready to have your horizons expanded?! Here we go:

**1. Smoothie bowls.** Ok, let's get the obvious one out of the way. Adding the smoothie booster to smoothies and smoothie bowls.... you can do the math on that one. Lots of collagen that's super easy for your body to absorb? You betcha. Toss it in there.
