## What is Bone Broth? 

Bone broth is made by slow cooking animal bones and connective tissues for long periods of time. The result is a rich broth full of amino acids, collagen, gelatin, glucosamine, electrolytes, calcium, and other minerals and nutrients.

## What are the health benefits?

As a staple in the traditional diets of various cultures, bone broth has incredible health benefits, primarily for the gut. It has long been claimed that the gut is the body's second brain, and therefore any disruptions to gut health can have various consequences for other organ systems within the body. Bone broth can help to strengthen the lining of the entire digestive system, fight food sensitivities, promote the growth of probiotics in the gut, and control inflammation. In addition to balancing the health of the gut, the collagen in bone broth also encourages healthy skin, hair and nails.
