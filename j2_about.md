## Our Founder

A born and raised small town Albertan, Whitney grew up around cattle, horses and cowboys where being part of her community was a cornerstone of her upbringing. Before embarking on the crazy journey of entrepreneurship, she worked as a registered nurse in addiction and mental health for a decade and completed her Master of Nursing degree in 2018. Whitney enjoys spending her time sipping wine, eating delicious food, and laughing non-stop with her family and friends.

## More Than Just Bone Broth

At Borderland Food Co, we truly believe in supporting our community. When the time came to hire employees for Borderland, Whitney wanted to hire thoughtfully and in a way that would add value to her community. Given her background working in addictions and mental health, she knew that she wanted to positively impact the communities with which she had worked during her nursing career. It was at that time that Borderland Food Co developed itâ€™s hiring practice:

> "Borderland Food Co provides a supportive, judgement free work environment for individuals who are recovering from addictions and we endeavour to hire individuals who fit this description wherever possible." 

We are proud to be more than just a bone broth company, and thanks to our hiring philosophy, we have built an amazing team who make amazing products.
